 Driving Behavior 

Lane Change Completed:
"Has the car already completed a lane change in any of the pictures?"
"Is there any indication that the car has finished changing lanes in the given images?"

Ongoing Lane Change:
"Is the car currently in the process of changing lanes in any of the pictures?"
"Can you identify any image where the car is actively engaged in a lane change?"

Turn Signal Activation:
"In any of the pictures, has the car activated its turn signal, suggesting a lane change?"
"Is there evidence of the car signaling a lane change in the provided images?"

Proximity to Lane Markings:
"Does any picture show the car in close proximity to lane markings, indicating an ongoing or imminent lane change?"
"Can you confirm if the car is close to lane markings in any of the images, possibly signifying a lane change?"

Directional Movement:
"Is there any evidence of lateral movement in the pictures, suggesting a lane change has occurred or is occurring?"
"Do any of the images show the car moving sideways, possibly indicating a lane change?"

Adjacent Lane Presence:
"In any of the pictures, is the car located in the adjacent lane, suggesting a successful lane change?"
"Can you confirm if the car has moved into the neighboring lane in any of the provided images?"

Sequence Images 
To determine which picture in a sequence depicts a car doing a lane change, you can use specific prompts that focus on the visual elements and characteristics associated with a lane change. Here are some prompts you can use:
Identify Lane Markings:
"Is the car positioned between lane markings in any of the pictures?"
"Look for the presence of dashed or solid lane markings. Does any picture show the car crossing these markings?"


Direction of Car Movement:
"Examine the direction of the car in each picture. Is there any picture where the car appears to be changing its direction laterally?"
"Check if the car is moving towards the adjacent lane in any of the images."

Wheel Orientation:
"Observe the wheels of the car in each picture. Is there any indication that the wheels are turning, suggesting a lane change?"

Surrounding Vehicles:
"Are there other vehicles in the adjacent lane in any of the pictures?"
"Look for signs of interaction or proximity with other vehicles in the neighboring lanes."

Signal Lights:
"Check for the activation of turn signals. Does any picture show the car signaling a lane change?"

Position in the Lane:
"Evaluate the position of the car within its current lane. Does any picture show the car positioning itself towards the edge of the lane, indicating a lane change?"

Sequential Analysis:
"Examine the pictures in sequence. Look for a progression where the car starts in one lane and gradually moves into another lane."

Surrounding Environment:
"Consider the background and surroundings in each picture. Does any picture show a change in the environment consistent with a lane change?"
